Procedural ->list of instructions to execute -> creating functions
Design issue : Temporal coupling 

Data and procedure are bundled as a single unit -> modular programming


OOP -> can Procedural too.
Constructor: does not class over the same data, procedures is same but not data
Same procedure on distinct data -> oop benefits
Objects: independent copies of data with same internal structure
Class : blueprint where objects are created
Data in class are called fields  (int a, int b, …)
This -> reference 

Memory Allocation:
First allocate the memory and then to call a constructor to fil the data.
But the memory needs to be released when the object is not in use.

Memory Deallocation:
Delete object1
Delete object2

DANGLING POINTER:
For example if we have 3 obj:
Obj 1 -> field1
		Field 2
Obj 2 -> field 1
		Field 2
Obj3 -> field 1
		Field 2
Obj=obj3
Delete obj2
Delete obj3
Here obj is still pointing at 3. So this is a dangling pointer

Delete all object that is not referenced!

Functional -> can OOP and Procedural

C# is based on garbage collection: no delete statement
If you don’t need an object, then just let execution pass through the method and when
It's over, the reference to the object will be forgotten. That object will be subject to garbage collection
C# uses common language runtime (? research it!)

JAVA -> uses run time env

Fundamentals of C# -> can do the procedural, OOP and fuctional -> but born OOP
Types
DateTime -> custom implementation which relies on the primitive type int
% - remainder
/-dividend, drops the remainder
+ -> concatination
= -> assignment
== -> is equivalence eg if(a==b)
! -> negation
&& -> and
|| -> or
return value is not implied 
Method names in C# is beginning with the Capital letter
reassingin the value to a variable when the object has already been created and value has been passed to it is illegal in C# and the compiler acts as there is not such field in the object in the first place.

/*
class School{
    int schoolID;
    int foundDate;

    public School(int ID, int _founfDate){
        schoolID = ID;
        foundDate = _founfDate

    }

    //static - meaning it does not belong to the object, no reference (this) to static method
    public static void Main(){
        School sc1 = new School(1, 1998);
        /* although this statement is syntatically correct, C# compiler acts as there is not such field schoolID in the object in the first place.
          - that field and other field are inside School and declared as private, not visible from inside when there is no access modifier 
          - "public" in the School constructor
        */
        sc1.schoolID = 2; 
    }

}
